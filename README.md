This project encompasses the implementation of various data structures such as ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and MinHeap. 
These structures utilize generics, enhancing their versatility to accommodate different element types. 
The MyArrayList class is a dynamic array, offering efficient random element access and capacity expansion when necessary. 
The MyLinkedList class, a doubly linked list, provides optimal insertions and deletions at both the list's extremities. 
The MyStack class operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) basis and is underpinned by a LinkedList, allowing elements to be added and removed from the stack's top. 
Conversely, the MyQueue class, supported by a LinkedList, adheres to a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) protocol, with elements entering at the back and exiting from the front. 
The MyMinHeap class, structured around an ArrayList, functions as a binary min-heap that keeps the smallest element at the root, supporting key operations such as insertions, minimum element extraction, and heapifying to preserve the heap structure. 
Each data structure includes various methods for element manipulation and retrieval, alongside functionalities to assess their size and whether they are empty.
